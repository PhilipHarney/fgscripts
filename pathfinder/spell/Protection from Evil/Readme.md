# Protection from Evil
The below effect should ideally be added as a Spell Action (Effect) to the *Actions* area of the character sheet. This will allow it to have the correct duration. 

**Protection from Evil**

*Target:* Target

*Action:* All

*Duration:* Caster Level (CL) in minutes (MIN). 10 times this for Circle of Protection.

*Effect Text:* `Protection from Evil; IFT(evil); AC:2 deflection; SAVE: 2 resistance; Immune to mental control;`

## How to use
- When casting the spell, apply the effect to any relevant targets. 
- For other alignments, the word *evil* can be replaced by *good*, *lawful* or *chaotic*

## Notes
- If using Circle of Protection rather than normal protection, you will need to check each turn who is actually within your Aura and enable/disable the effect on them, as FG has no "Aura" functionality (despite it being mentioned on the wiki)
- Fantasy Grounds does not currently have a way of modelling the immunity to mental control effect, so it has simply been added as a text reminder in the effect. 
- Similarly, FG does not have a way of knowing if a target is already charmed, and therefore cannot give the +2 Morale bonus to the free saving throw. 
- Lastly, FG does not have any way to know if a creature is "summoned", so it cannot simulate the defense granted vs. summoned creatures natural attacks.
