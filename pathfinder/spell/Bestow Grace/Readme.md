# BESTOW GRACE

The below effect should ideally be added as a Spell Action (Effect) to the *Actions* area of the character sheet. This will allow it to have the correct duration. 

**BLESS WEAPON**

*Target:* Target

*Action:* All

*Duration:* Caster Level (CL) in minutes (MIN)

*Effect Text:* `Bestow Grace; IF:ALIGN(good);SAVE: 2 sacred;`

## Notes
- Fantasy Grounds does not have any parameters that take the TARGETS Charisma score into account. Therefore you will need to check their CHA modifier and adjust the sacred bonus accordingly *before* applying the effect.
