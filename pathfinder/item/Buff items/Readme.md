# Character Boosting Items

There are a number of character boosting items in 3.5e/Pathfinder. Most of these provide Enhancement, Resistance and Deflection bonuses. Since this means they don't stack with bonuses from other sources that have the same type (e.g. spells), we need to model these items as Effects on a character within Fantasy Grounds. 

## How to use
- Set up a new *Spell Class* for keeping your Item effects in - I use one simply called *Utility Abilities* and use it for all my Feat + Item effects.
- For each item with an effect, add a Spell Action, and choose Effect. 
- Add the relevant effect text (see examples in this folder)
- Setup targetting for your effect. Generally it will be as follows:

*Target:* Self

*Action:* All

- When applying the buff, just click on the effect button and it will automatically apply to your character thanks to the "Target:Self". 
- If an item effect has a duration after activate (e.g. Ring of Invisibility), simply add the relevant duration to the Effect action. 

## Notes
- If a single item has multiple effects, you can simply chain them together. E.g. `Belt of Physical Perfection; STR:2 enhancement;DEX:2 enhancement;CON:2 enhancement` 
- Constitution bonuses **do not** automatically grant a character additional HP. You will need to ensure that bonus HP from CON gets added or removed manually.
