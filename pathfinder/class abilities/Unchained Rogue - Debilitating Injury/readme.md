# Debilitating Injury

An Unchained Rogue can apply a debuff effect to a foe they strike with a Sneak Attack. 

Each effect should be set up in the *Actions* tab of the Character sheet as a *Spell*. The effect should be implemented as a  *Spell Action* - *Effect*. Duration of the effect should be set using the magnifying glass beside the effect text. 

## How to use
The debuff applied by a rogue actually has a twofold effect. Once general debuff, and then an additional debuff that applies when targetting the rogue themselves.

As such, when applying your Debilitating Injury effect the debuff should be applied twice to each foe, and the second effect should be targetted to the originating rogue. 

The targetting of the secondary effect means it will only apply to the Rogue.

Example:
- Rogue sneak attacks an Orc
- Rogue applies the Bewildered effect to the Orc (-2 AC)
- Rogue applies the Bewildered effect again to the Orc (-2 AC)
- Rogue targets the second effect so that it targets the Rogue
- Fighter attacks the Orc. Orc suffers a -2 AC penalty
- Rogue attacks the Orc. Orc suffers a -4 AC penalty
