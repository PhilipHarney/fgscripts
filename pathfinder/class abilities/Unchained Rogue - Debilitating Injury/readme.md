# Debilitating Injury

An Unchained Rogue can apply a debuff effect to a foe they strike with a Sneak Attack. 

## How to use
The debuff applied by a rogue actually has a twofold effect. Once general debuff, and then an additional debuff that applies when targetting the rogue themselves.

As such, when applying your Debilitating Injury effect the debuff should be applied twice to each foe, and the second effect should be targetted to the originating rogue.
