# Lay on Hands + Channel Energy
I have decided to put both of these together since they are both very closely related.

## Positive Energy Spell Class

- Go to Actions tab of character sheet
- Add a new *Spell Class*
- Call new spell class whatever you want - Channel or Lay on Hands
- Set Caster Type as *Points(Psion)*
- Set maximum number of *Points* to be equal to your resource limit (3+Cha for Clerics, 1/2 LVL + Cha for Paladins)
- Set related stat as CHA for DC's
- Ensure CL = Level

### Lay On Hands

- Add a new 1st level "spell" called Lay on Hands to your positive energy spell class
- Add a **Cast** Action. Edit using maginfying glass and set Save for half to true. 
- Add a **Heal** Action (for healing the living)
- Set Healing = 1d6 x Even CL
- Add a **Damage** Action (for harming Undead)
- Set Damage = 1d6 x Even CL

### Channel Energy
- If **Cleric**, add a new 1st level "spell" called Channel to your positive energy spell class
- If **Paladin**, add a new 2nd level "spell" called Channel to your positive energy spell class
- Add a **Cast** Action. Edit using maginfying glass and set Save for half to true. 
- Add a **Heal** Action (for healing the living)
- Set Healing = 1d6 x Odd CL
- Add a **Damage** Action (for harming Undead)
- Set Damage = 1d6 x Odd CL

## Using Positive Energy
- Whenever you wish to use positive energy, just click the usage icon beside the relevant *Spell* (Lay on Hands or Channel) to use up your limited resources. A message will be shown in chat if you don't have enough uses left.
- If **Healing**, just drag the healing icon (+ symbol) onto the relevant target to be healed, or target them using targetting and click. If a target is resisting the healing (e.g. a superstitious barbarian) use the *Save* button in the Cast action first. 
- If doing **Damage**, e.g. to undead, select all relevant targets using targetting. Then use the *Save* button in the Cast action of the spell. Following this, click the **Damage** icon. Damage will be applied to all targets, and 1/2 damage will be applied to those that passed their saves.
