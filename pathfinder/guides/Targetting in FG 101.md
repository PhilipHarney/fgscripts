# Targetting
Targetting in FG can be a very useful and time-saving activity. It allows you to apply effects easily, or to ensure that abilities only function for the relevant opponent.

Unfortunately, actually figuring out how targetting works or how to use it are not all that intuitive - which is complicated by there being multiple ways of doing it. 

## Effects and Tokens
Firstly, lets clarify that there are actually 2 different types of targetting. Targetting for Effects, and Targetting for Tokens. A single character can have both active at the same time, with different lists of targets, so lets clarify this! 

### Token Targets
Token targetting is likely going to be the most common type and easily used type. 
This type of targetting should be used when you want to affect 1 or more other tokens in some way. An example would be selecting everyone in the blast radius of a Fireball spell so you can make them all roll saves and take damage at the same time. 
This will affect the default target(s) for actions you take from your character sheet until you un-target things. 

### Effect Targets
An Effect that is active on a character can have its own Target(s), independent of who the character themselves is targetting.
This is used to model situations like Smite Evil, where a Paladin gets benefits vs. a single enemy, or the companion option for a Rangers Hunter's Bond ability where they can grant their Favored Enemy bonus to their companions - but only against a single target. 
Characters can continue to take their actions as normal, and the effect will only kick in once they take a relevant action against the specified target. 

## Targetting Basics
When you target a token, all actions you take from you character sheet will, by default, be against all your current targets if they can affect something other than your own character.
So, for example, if you roll an attack by double-clicking on a Weapon action in your sheet instead of dropping it onto an enemy token, it will roll that attack against every target instead of just rolling it in the chat window. 
Another example would be for Action Effects. If you have an Spell that has an Action which affects *Target* instead of *Self*, then the effect will be applied to all current targets (useful for buffs + debuffs). 

## How to Target
To actually target something, there are a couple of pre-requisites that need to be met:
- The target token must be on the Combat Tracker
- The targetting token must be on the Combat Tracker
- The player must have visibility of both tokens on the Combat Tracker
- **Note**: It is beneficial to have both tokens be on the battlemap too, but it actually is not strictly required, since you can use the Combat Tracker ;)

Once these are met, there are a number of ways that you can target a token. When a token is targetted, a line will be drawn from the source to the target(s) when you hover your mouse over the token doing the targetting. In addition, the name of the target(s) will be displayed in the Combat Tracker tile for the source token (usually a player character)

### Battlemap
- Select the source token (it will generally have a white halo to indicate it is selected)
- Control+click the target 
- Control+click any additional targets
- Control+click a previously targetted token to un-target them

### Combat Tracker 
- Open the **Target** interface for the source token in the Combat Tracker
- Drag the target icon onto the intended target
- Drag the target icon onto any additional targets
- Click the the name of a target in the "target" list of your tile in the Combat Tracker to un-target a token
- Click the "Cancel" button in the targetting interface to clear all targets

### Target All
- Provided that the GM enables it, there is an option to target all visible enemies or allies.
- If enabled, simply click the relevant "Target Enemies", "Target Allies" or "Clear Targets" button in the top left of the battlemap.
