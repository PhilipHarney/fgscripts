# ONGOING DAMAGE

There are a number of ways that a character can become effect by ongoing damage. THe most common are probably bleeding(e.g. rogue sneak attack), acid damage (e.g. Acid Arrow) or being on fire.

FantasyGrounds allows you to model this so that you don't have to manually keep track or remember by using the DMGO action. Ongoing damage will be applied at the start of the turn of the effected creature. 

## Example Ongoing Damage

**ON FIRE!!!**

*Effect Text:* `On Fire!; DMGO: 1d6 fire`

**Bleeding**

*Effect Text:*	`Bleeding; DMGO: 4;`

**Acid Damage**

*Effect Text:*	`Bleeding; DMGO: 2d4 acid;`

## How to Use
1. Adjust the damage of the effect to reflect the source. The value can either be a flat number (`4`), a set of dice (`2d4`), or a combination of both (`1d6+2`)
2. Ensure the effect has the correct intended duration (e.g. 3 rounds)
3. Apply effect to target
