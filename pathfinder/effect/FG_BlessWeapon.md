# BLESS WEAPON

The below effect should ideally be added as a Spell Action (Effect) to the *Actions* area of the character sheet. This will allow it to have the correct duration. 

**BLESS WEAPON**

*Target:* Self

*Action:* All

*Duration:* Caster Level (CL) in minutes (MIN)

*Effect Text:* `Bless Weapon; IFT:ALIGN(evil);CC:100;`

## How to use
- Simply click the Effect in the spell actions. Nothing else required!

## Notes
- To simulate the auto-confirmed critical vs. evil enemies, I simply added a +100 to the critcal confirm roll.
